Welcome! <br> My name is Po-Shao (Chris) Chen, a graduate student research assistant in VLSI-SP Group at University of Michigan (UMich). I am now working on the project of digital VLSI design under the supervision of Prof. Zhengya Zhang. <br/>
I received my B.S. degree in electrical engineering in 2018 and M.S. degree in electronics engineering in 2021 from NTU. My research interests include hardware architecture and VLSI design for digital signal processing.<br/>
During my free time, I like participating in a variety of sports, such as volleyball, badminton, and table-tennis. I am also fond of jogging and weight training. <br/>
