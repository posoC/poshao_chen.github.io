Welcome! <br> My name is Po-Shao (Chris) Chen, a research assistant in Digital Circuits and Systems Lab at National Taiwan University (NTU). <br/>
I am now working on the project of digital VLSI design under the supervision of Prof. Chia-Hsiang Yang. <br/>
I received my B.S. degree in electrical engineering in 2018 and M.S. degree in electronics engineering in 2021 from NTU. My research interests include hardware architecture and VLSI design for digital signal processing.<br/>
During my free time, I like participating in a variety of sports, such as volleyball, badminton, and ping-pong. I am also fond of jogging and weight training. <br/>
