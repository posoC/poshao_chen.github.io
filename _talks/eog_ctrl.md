With the help of robots, people can finish their tasks remotely. To make people control the machines intuitively, we built the system which can make people manipulate the machine with their body's movement. In this project, we focused on the vision control. The electrodes are attached to the user's area near the eyes. When the muscles near the eyes move, EOG signals are transferred from electrodes to the filter circuit. The filter removes the noise of the raw EOG signal to make the Arduino board easily analyze signals and accurately control the movement of the webcam.
