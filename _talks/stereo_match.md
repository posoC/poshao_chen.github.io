The project includes the stereo matching for synthetic and real images. To enhance the result, several image processing methods are applied in our stereo matching algorithm:
* Synthetic/Real data classification
* Image rectification
* Histogram equalization
* Max disparity estimation
* Weighted cost computation
* Loopy belief propagation
* Left right check
* Hole filling
* Edge smoothing
