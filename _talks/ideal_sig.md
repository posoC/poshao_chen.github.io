The goal of the project is to enhance the speed of the gas sensing system. To achieve this, I adopted the partial signal generated by gasâ€™s heating and cooling process. Not only it reduced complexity of calculation, but the amount of needed signal data was also decreased. The ideal signals were reconstructed only from a few cycles of the raw signal and adjust them with different modification. Mean and variance of the difference between the raw signal and the modified ideal signals were then estimated and recorded. The ideal signal with zero mean and least variance was chosen, and its slope value was used for differentiation of the gas concentration.
