**Abstract:** This work presents the world’s first post-quantum hybrid crypto SoC that achieves an 800Mpbs throughput and consumes only 4. 8mW for remote neural interfacing. The chip dissipates 0.70μJ/OP for the handshake and 48pJ/B for data encryption in 40nm CMOS. Flexible authenticated encryption is supported. This work achieves 3-175x higher area efficiency with 16-41x less energy than state-of-the-art designs.

**Abstract:** This work presents an energy-efficient accelerator that implements a dark channel prior based deblurring algorithm. With the proposed Laplace's equation solver, the dark channel re-assigner and the conjugate gradient solver, a latency reduction of 76% for a 257x257 blurred image is achieved. The chip estimates a blur kernel for a full HD image in 1.7s and dissipates 28.8 mW at 65 MHz from a 0.65V supply. Compared to the state-of-the-art design, this work supports 4× and 2.9× larger image size and blur kernel size. It even achieves 4x [7.5x] higher normalized area [energy] efficiency, despite the better capability of image deblurring.
